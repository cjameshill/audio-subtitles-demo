00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.970
Thank you Aquafina for taking that beautiful bullet for all of us.

2
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.010
And thank God, I wrote my speech down.

3
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.210
Hi

4
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.960
Alan, we gotta keep the best friend stuff kind of on the deal.

5
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.660
Okay, because a lot of my best friends are here. Um

6
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.880
Okay.

7
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.560
I mean,

8
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.540
you would think after 30 years of being in

9
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.390
this industry getting up here would be easy.

10
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.880
And uh, it's not it's it's terrifying. Um it's not that often.

11
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.430
We're surrounded by people who found their voice and are using it

12
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.760
and using it to hold people up and bring people together.

13
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.830
And uh, that to me is true power.

14
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.490
I mean, it's funny because I've never, you know,

15
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.230
I've never actually thought about myself as powerful.

16
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.260
I mean strong. Yes, but powerful. Not.

17
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.660
Um,

18
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.040
it's a it's a distinction I've actually been thinking

19
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.040
a lot about lately because the word power um,

20
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.410
and its counterpart abusive power

21
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.710
keeps coming up in light of what is happening in our country,

22
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.630
in our in our industry,

23
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.650
a rebalancing of the scales, I guess you could say.

24
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.900
And uh,

25
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.460
I've been thinking about my own relationship with that word with the word power,

26
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.320
which got me thinking about um,

27
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.180
my first

28
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.040
my early associations

29
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.940
from my early associations with my own sense of power.

30
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.290
Something I believe comes from using our voice.

31
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.700
And I remember the parental

32
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.950
figures saying to me

33
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.920
Around the rather critical age of about 11

34
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.770
after a dinner party,

35
00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.600
um,

36
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.560
that I was excused from the table because I

37
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.750
didn't have anything interesting to add to the conversation.

38
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.810
Ouch.

39
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.870
Um and it's stuck with me,

40
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.850
It stuck with me, like, painfully worded sentences can,

41
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.150
And if I'm being honest,

42
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.810
and I'm being honest because I'm 50 and you know, that comes with the territory,

43
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.150
That's right.

44
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.910
So I carried that sentence with me into adulthood

45
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.460
And I always felt incredibly comfortable giving, you know,

46
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.100
a voice to the words of others,

47
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.930
but put me at a dinner table with strangers or at a podium like this,

48
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.280
and I go right back to being 11 years old.

49
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.160
This last,

50
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.760
the last two years has made me think a lot about the messages that we send young kids,

51
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.600
little girls, especially

52
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.150
how the things that we say and do can either build them up or it

53
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.630
can tear them down and make them feel like maybe their voices don't matter.

54
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.400
And it wasn't until

55
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.020
friends took off that I started seeing myself in a different light.

56
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.160
I started meeting all of these people who

57
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.280
expressed to me how much the show meant to them,

58
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.900
how it lifted their spirits during a bad breakup or or got them through an illness.

59
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.940
And I was just so incredibly moved by that and I began to um change the way

60
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.030
I thought about my own voice and what it meant to have a platform to use it.

61
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.050
Still no prompter

62
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.290
and then enter marlo thomas marlo thomas.

63
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.480
Uh some of you might remember,

64
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.110
she was my mama on friends and I remember one day we were on set and she said to me,

65
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.200
I'm going to this ST jude gala tonight, would you like to be my date?

66
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.870
And I said, yeah, I'd love to be your date and go to that.

67
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.140
So there we are at this big elaborate gala,

68
00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.370
there's tuxes and gowns and tiny little food on

69
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.570
toothpicks that you can't eat in any dignified manner.

70
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.910
And uh, I sat down at the table and they started to roll this tape of of the hospital

71
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.240
And I sat there watching it moved to tears and that was it. That was it for me.

72
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.430
I wanted to be a part of this extraordinary organization and that was 25 years ago

73
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.510
and I am very honored to be a part of ST jude.

74
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.150
Um

75
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.790
and I've been in love with him ever since.

76
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.500
And right around this time every fall we shoot the P. S. A.

77
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.880
For the holiday P. S. A. And I get to spend a day with the family of ST jude

78
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.130
and I always say it's the best day of the year and the hardest day of the year.

79
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.400
Um and a few years back, I met a little girl named Sawyer

80
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.710
who I still think about to this day.

81
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.640
She was seven at the time and I remember she

82
00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.110
had this pink little dress on and these big angelic eyeballs

83
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.340
and the chemo had taken all of her hair

84
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.130
and she had these tiny little tumors on her body that she called her bumps,

85
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.540
her rallies

86
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.110
and she just sat on my lap and smiling and cuddling with me the

87
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.910
whole time as we ran through the script again and again and again,

88
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.350
and after hearing this word at the end of the day,

89
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.970
after hearing the word repeated over and over again,

90
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.940
she looked up at me with those big blue eyeballs and she asked me what is cancer

91
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.700
and I just looked at her and I was like, oh God,

92
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.450
I'm not equipped to answer this question, Birds and the bees,

93
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.070
oh you're too young for that.

94
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.700
But so

95
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.150
I

96
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.720
I never sorry,

97
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.080
but seriously, I mean I never forgot about that moment.

98
00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.050
Here was this little girl who was fighting this deadly disease every

99
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.070
single day and she didn't even know what the word was for it

100
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.730
and it was just part of her reality and she was just making the absolute best of it.

101
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.130
And that's what's unbelievable about these Children,

102
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.120
despite everything

103
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.690
that they are up against and as much pain as they are often in, they are vibrant,

104
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.560
they're joyful, they're fearless

105
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.420
and that's

106
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.440
part of the magic of ST jude

107
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.930
and why I'm so honored to support their

108
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.590
work because they're giving Children the best care on

109
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.150
the planet so that they can reclaim their childhood

110
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.900
so that they can find their little inner superhero

111
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.530
and they're doing it at no cost

112
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.060
so that the families can focus on their little ones

113
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.280
um live without

114
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:53.170
without worrying about crippling hospital bills and their pioneering treatment,

115
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.470
cutting edge treatments that will soon one day find a cure.

116
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.040
And that is what every child deserves to know.

117
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.530
That they are seeing, that they are powerful

118
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.280
and they are loved,

119
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.380
that they deserve a seat at the table

120
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.710
and that anything they have to say or any question they have to ask is a value,

121
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.010
even if we don't have all the answers for it.

122
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.300
So thank you very much for recognizing the work of this remarkable organization

123
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.200
and for celebrating the power in each and every one of us.

124
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.150
Thank you.
